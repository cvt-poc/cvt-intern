You are an expert DevOps/SRE Technical Director with 20+ years of experience who has successfully mentored junior engineers into senior roles. You've built and scaled multiple DevOps practices at Fortune 500 companies and successful startups. You excel at breaking down complex concepts into manageable learning paths and are known for creating exceptional documentation.

Create a comprehensive 24-week day-by-day roadmap for a DevOps/SRE intern project. The project is: [Detect_Drift] that solves [Config drift between Git and live clusters].

As a Technical Director, design this plan with the precision and depth you would use for your highest-potential interns. Consider that these are fresh graduates with theoretical knowledge but limited practical experience. Your goal is to transform them into capable junior DevOps engineers through this single project.

For each day (all 120 working days), create detailed markdown files with the following structure:

# Week [X] Day [Y]: [Specific Focus Title]

## Overview
- Duration: Full day (8 hours)
- Why This Matters: [Practical significance for DevOps/SRE professionals]
- Connection to Project: [How today's work contributes to the overall project]

## Learning Objectives
[5 specific, measurable outcomes the intern should achieve]

## Prerequisites
[Knowledge, tools, and access needed]

## Morning Session (4 hours)
### Technical Concept Deep Dive (90 minutes)
[3 key concepts with detailed explanations, code examples, and common misconceptions]
### Hands-on Exploration (2.5 hours)
[Setup instructions and 3 exercises with step-by-step guidance]

## Afternoon Session (4 hours)
### Implementation Challenge (3 hours)
[A practical task applying morning concepts with requirements, steps, deliverables, and testing procedures]
### Documentation and Reflection (1 hour)
[Documentation requirements and reflection questions]

## Resources
[Essential reading, reference docs, video tutorials, and code examples]

## Troubleshooting Guide
[Table of common issues, symptoms, and solutions]

## Mentorship and Support
[Check-in schedule, guidance on when/how to ask for help]

## Extension Activities
[Additional challenges for quick learners]

## Preparation for Tomorrow
[Resources to review and setup tasks]

## Success Criteria
[Specific deliverables and quality standards]

Drawing from your extensive enterprise DevOps experience, ensure the plan shows clear progression through these phases:
1. Foundation Phase (Weeks 1-2)
2. Exploration Phase (Weeks 3-6)
3. Basic Implementation Phase (Weeks 7-10)
4. Advanced Implementation Phase (Weeks 11-14)
5. Integration Phase (Weeks 15-18)
6. Packaging Phase (Weeks 19-22)
7. Finalization Phase (Weeks 23-24)

As a DevOps architect who values automation, include a script that will generate a git repository with this structure:
project/
├── README.md
├── setup/
├── resources/
└── weekly_tasks/
    ├── week-1/
    │   ├── README.md
    │   ├── day-1.md
    │   └── ...
    └── ...

As an expert mentor, provide a complete example of Week 1, Day 1 for [PROJECT_TITLE] with all sections fully developed, showing the level of technical detail expected. This example should demonstrate your ability to explain complex concepts clearly while maintaining technical rigor and accuracy.
