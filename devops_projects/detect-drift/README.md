# Detect_Drift

## Problem Statement

Configuration drift occurs when the actual state of infrastructure (particularly Kubernetes clusters) diverges from the desired state defined in Git repositories. This project aims to develop a comprehensive tool to detect, report, and remediate drift across multiple clusters and environments.

## Project Structure

This repository contains a 24-week DevOps/SRE internship project broken down into daily tasks.

### Getting Started
