# Week 1 Day 1: Introduction to GitOps and Configuration Drift

## Overview

- **Duration**: Full day (8 hours)
- **Why This Matters**: Configuration drift is one of the most common yet challenging problems in modern infrastructure management. When live environments don't match their declared state in version control, it leads to inconsistent environments, failed deployments, security vulnerabilities, and difficult-to-diagnose production issues.
- **Connection to Project**: Today establishes the foundation for our Detect_Drift tool by understanding the problem space, exploring existing approaches, and defining our unique value proposition. Without this conceptual foundation, we can't build an effective solution.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of today, you will be able to:
- Explain the concept of configuration drift and its impact on DevOps practices
- Describe the principles of GitOps and how they relate to drift detection
- Compare at least three existing approaches to drift detection and their limitations
- Set up a basic local Kubernetes environment with a Git repository
- Manually create and detect a simple case of configuration drift

## Prerequisites

- Computer with at least 8GB RAM, 4 CPU cores, and 20GB free disk space
- Basic understanding of Git (cloning, committing, pushing)
- Familiarity with YAML syntax
- Terminal/command-line basics
- Administrator access to install software
