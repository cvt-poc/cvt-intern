## Project Details

### 1. Drift-Detect

**Project Description:**  
A GitHub Action that compares the live Kubernetes cluster state (via kubectl diff) against the Helm template output on pull requests, blocking any changes that would cause drift.

**Pain Point:**  
Configuration drift between what's in Git (the desired state) and what's actually running in live clusters. This causes unpredictable behavior, failed deployments, and can lead to security vulnerabilities or outages.

**Business Use Case:**  
Organizations implementing GitOps need to ensure their Git repositories remain the single source of truth. When emergency changes are made directly to clusters and not committed back to Git, deployments become inconsistent and unreliable, increasing operational risk.

**Solution Approach:**
- Create a GitHub Action that runs during PR validation
- Execute Helm template to generate expected manifests
- Use kubectl diff to compare against the live cluster state
- Block PRs if drift is detected (live cluster changes not in Git)
- Generate detailed reports of detected drift for remediation
- Provide allowlists for acceptable differences (like auto-generated fields)

### 2. K8s-AutoScaler Advisor

**Project Description:**  
A CLI tool that analyzes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) configurations against current metrics (via Prometheus API) and recommends optimal targets, outputting a comprehensive JSON report.

**Pain Point:**  
Suboptimal autoscaling settings lead to resource thrashing, poor performance, and cost inefficiencies. Teams often configure autoscalers based on guesswork rather than actual usage patterns.

**Business Use Case:**  
Cloud resource optimization is critical for cost control and application performance. Properly tuned autoscalers reduce cloud spend while ensuring applications have sufficient resources during peak demand.

**Solution Approach:**
- Query the Kubernetes API for current HPA/VPA configurations
- Connect to Prometheus to extract historical resource utilization
- Analyze usage patterns, peaks, and trends
- Calculate optimal autoscaling parameters based on usage patterns
- Generate recommendations with confidence scores
- Produce actionable Kubernetes manifests with suggested changes

### 3. Secrets-Lifecycle

**Project Description:**  
A CLI and GitHub Action that automates Kubernetes Secrets rotation via AWS Secrets Manager integration and issues pull requests with updated manifests.

**Pain Point:**  
Manual secret rotation is error-prone and often neglected. When secrets aren't regularly rotated, they pose increasing security risks over time.

**Business Use Case:**  
Security compliance requirements often mandate regular credential rotation. Automating this process reduces security risks while minimizing operational overhead and human error.

**Solution Approach:**
- Connect to AWS Secrets Manager to generate new secrets
- Track secret lifetimes and determine rotation schedules
- Create new secret versions in Kubernetes
- Generate pull requests with updated references
- Support gradual rollout to avoid service disruption
- Maintain a comprehensive audit trail of rotations

### 4. Helm-Score

**Project Description:**  
A REST service wrapping helm lint and kubeval, scoring Helm charts on security, best practices, and custom policies using Open Policy Agent (OPA).

**Pain Point:**  
Helm charts often lack security validation and adherence to best practices, leading to vulnerable deployments and operational issues.

**Business Use Case:**  
Standardizing and automatically validating chart quality ensures consistent, secure deployments across the organization. This reduces incidents and simplifies compliance reporting.

**Solution Approach:**
- Create a REST API service wrapping Helm validation tools
- Implement a scoring algorithm weighing different aspects:
  - Security (privileged containers, network policies, etc.)
  - Resource management (limits, requests, quotas)
  - Reliability (health checks, pod disruption budgets)
  - Custom organizational policies via OPA
- Generate detailed reports with remediation suggestions
- Support integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Track improvement over time with historical scoring

### 5. Chaos-Injector

**Project Description:**  
A unified wrapper around Chaos Engineering tools (primarily Litmus) that offers a consistent CLI to trigger various chaos experiments (CPU, network, pod-kill) and collect metrics.

**Pain Point:**  
Running chaos experiments is currently fragmented across multiple tools with inconsistent interfaces, making it difficult to incorporate resilience testing into regular workflows.

**Business Use Case:**  
Building resilient systems requires proactively testing failure scenarios. A standardized chaos testing framework helps teams identify weaknesses before they cause production incidents.

**Solution Approach:**
- Create a unified CLI to interact with multiple chaos tools
- Support common chaos experiments:
  - CPU/Memory pressure
  - Network latency and packet loss
  - Pod termination
  - Disk I/O degradation
- Integrate with metrics systems to capture service behavior
- Define experiments as code for repeatability
- Generate reports comparing system behavior during chaos
- Support scheduling regular chaos testing in production

### 6. Cost-Tagger

**Project Description:**  
A Terraform pre-commit hook and policy engine that enforces and automatically inserts cost allocation tags on new cloud resources.

**Pain Point:**  
Missing cost tags make it impossible to accurately allocate cloud expenses to teams, projects, or business units, hindering chargeback and cost optimization efforts.

**Business Use Case:**  
Accurate cost allocation is essential for cloud governance and budget accountability. Automated tagging ensures consistent classification without burdening developers.

**Solution Approach:**
- Implement a Terraform pre-commit hook to scan for missing tags
- Enforce organization-specific tagging policies
- Automatically insert default tags based on repository context
- Generate reports on tagging compliance
- Support retroactive tag application for existing resources
- Integrate with cloud cost dashboards to show tagged costs

### 7. Infra-Graph

**Project Description:**  
A dashboard that visualizes service-to-service call graphs in Kubernetes clusters using eBPF-derived metrics, allowing teams to understand application dependencies.

**Pain Point:**  
Teams struggle to understand service dependencies in complex microservice architectures, making it difficult to plan changes, predict impacts, or troubleshoot issues.

**Business Use Case:**  
Visualizing service relationships helps teams make better architectural decisions, improves incident response, and enhances change management processes.

**Solution Approach:**
- Deploy eBPF programs to capture network traffic between pods
- Aggregate and process connection data to build service graphs
- Create an interactive visualization showing:
  - Service dependencies and data flow direction
  - Traffic volume between services
  - Latency between services
  - Error rates between services
- Highlight potential bottlenecks or critical paths
- Enable filtering by namespace or service
- Support exporting architecture diagrams

### 8. Alert-Consolidator

**Project Description:**  
A Prometheus sidecar that de-duplicates alerts with identical labels, exporting a single aggregate alert and emitting a comprehensive incident summary.

**Pain Point:**  
Alert fatigue from duplicate notifications, particularly during outages when many similar alerts fire simultaneously, overwhelms response teams.

**Business Use Case:**  
Reducing alert noise allows operations teams to focus on resolving root causes rather than triaging duplicate notifications. This improves incident response times and team effectiveness.

**Solution Approach:**
- Intercept alerts from Prometheus Alertmanager
- Group alerts based on configurable similarity rules
- Create consolidated meta-alerts representing groups
- Generate incident summaries with contextual information
- Apply intelligent routing based on alert patterns
- Provide a dashboard showing alert consolidation metrics
- Support progressive alert escalation based on duration

### 9. Canary-Configurator

**Project Description:**  
A CLI and configuration library that transforms a standard Helm chart into a canary rollout configuration YAML (leveraging Argo Rollouts) with sensible defaults.

**Pain Point:**  
Teams struggle to author effective canary deployment manifests, making it difficult to implement progressive delivery strategies.

**Business Use Case:**  
Canary deployments reduce deployment risk by exposing new versions to limited traffic before full rollout. Automating this configuration lowers the barrier to safer deployment practices.

**Solution Approach:**
- Parse existing Helm charts and manifests
- Generate Argo Rollouts configurations with:
  - Traffic splitting rules
  - Health metric definitions
  - Promotion criteria
  - Rollback thresholds
- Apply organization-specific best practices
- Support customizing the canary process via configuration
- Include templated analysis runs for validation
- Generate visualization of the canary process

### 10. Release-Notes-Compiler

**Project Description:**  
A GitHub Action that aggregates merged PR titles, labels, and authors into formatted release notes markdown and Slack posts.

**Pain Point:**  
Manual release note creation is tedious, inconsistent, and often incomplete, yet release documentation is crucial for stakeholders.

**Business Use Case:**  
Comprehensive release notes improve communication with users, support teams, and other stakeholders. Automation ensures consistency and reduces the burden on development teams.

**Solution Approach:**
- Scan PRs merged since the last release or within a specified timeframe
- Extract relevant metadata (titles, labels, authors, linked issues)
- Categorize changes (features, fixes, improvements)
- Generate markdown documentation with appropriate formatting
- Create focused summaries for different audiences:
  - Technical details for engineering
  - User-facing changes for customers
  - High-level overview for management
- Post announcements to communication channels (Slack, Teams)
- Support customizable templates
